# Tic Tac Toe Game 




## 1. Project Overview

This Tic Tac Toe game is a simple yet engaging implementation developed in Python using the Tkinter library. It offers a classic gaming experience with the added flexibility of playing against another player or challenging an AI opponent. The game's interface is visually appealing, featuring a pink-themed color scheme and well-designed buttons for an intuitive user experience.


##  2. Features

The game is packed with several features to enhance gameplay. Players can choose between Multiplayer Mode and AI Mode, depending on whether they want to compete against a friend or test their skills against the computer. The game provides clear and dynamic updates on the status, showing messages like "X WINS THE GAME!" or "GAME DRAW!" based on the gameplay outcome.




## 3. Game Modes

This Tic Tac Toe game offers two distinct modes: Multiplayer Mode and AI Mode. In Multiplayer Mode, two players take turns to compete against each other. In AI Mode, the player competes against the computer, which is programmed to make strategic moves using the Minimax algorithm.


## 4. User Interface

The user interface is designed with simplicity and ease of use in mind. The pink-themed color scheme creates an inviting atmosphere, while the buttons are styled for clear visibility and easy interaction. The interface dynamically updates to reflect the current state of the game, making it accessible for players of all ages.





## 5. Artificial Intelligence (AI) Implementation

The AI in this game is powered by the Minimax algorithm, which enables the computer to make optimal moves. This ensures a challenging experience for players who choose to play in AI Mode, as the computer will always try to make the best possible move to win or force a draw.




## 6. Win and Draw Conditions

The game checks for win and draw conditions after each move. If a player forms a row, column, or diagonal of their symbol, they win the game, and the interface updates to announce the winner. If all cells are filled without a winner, the game declares a draw, providing a fair conclusion to every match.


## 7. Requirements

1. Python 3.x
2. tkinter
## 8. Restart Functionality

Players can easily restart the game after it ends by clicking the "RESTART GAME!" button. This resets the game board and allows players to choose their mode again, making it convenient to play multiple rounds without restarting the application.


## 9. How to Play

To play the game, run the Python file, choose your preferred mode (Multiplayer or AI), and start making moves by clicking on the grid cells. The game will automatically handle turn switching and update the status based on the moves made. If playing against the AI, the computer will take its turn after each of your moves.


## 10. Installation and Setup

To install and run the game, make sure you have Python installed on your system. Download or clone the repository, navigate to the directory containing the game file, and run it using Python. The game will open in a window, ready for you to start playing.


## 11. Technologies Used

This game is developed using Python and the Tkinter library. Tkinter is used to create the graphical user interface, handle user inputs, and manage the various screens and game states. The Minimax algorithm is implemented in Python to provide a robust AI opponent for players to challenge.
